# Assignment: Version Control and Documentation



 

# Objective

* Use Github for version control of your numerical library. 
* Use MarkDown to create a documentation for your  numerical method functions.

> **You will only be allowed to use the API  documentation in the Final Test**





## Part 1. Version Control

For each assignment, you probably have created ‘myNM.h, myNM.cpp’ files in every project folders. If there are multiple source files of the same file name, you may have a trouble in controlling the version of your library.

[Tutorial repository](https://github.com/ykkimhgu/tutorial-NM)



1. Create a **private** repository for numerical method 

   > Example:  numericalMethod

2. Create folders within the repository as instructed in the tutorial

3. Maintain your library source files`myNM.h, myNM.cpp` and `myMatrix.h, myMatrix.cpp` in   the ‘\include’ folder only 

4. Under the `\sources` folder,  push **assignment** files of `main() source c or cpp files` and `data txt file` only.

5. Under the `\sample`  folder, push **tutorial** files or any other example codes

6. Modify all your assignment source file to include your NM header which is located in that `\include folder of the repository.  

   > DO NOT copy the header files in each project folders. 

7. Screen-capture your github repository and submit.



## Part 2: Documentation

The documentation should contain 

* Function descriptions: syntax, description of parameters
* Example codes

[See the tutorial materials for help](https://github.com/ykkimhgu/tutorial-NM/blob/main/docs/NM_API_Documentation.md)



1. Create your API(numerical library) documentation for all the functions you have created in class.  You should use `markdown ` .

2. Upload the documentation file in your github repository. 

   >  example:  ~username/numerical-method/docs/NM_API_Documentation.md

3. You may need to add hyperlink in the documentation to link some of your example codes 

4.  You will use this documentation for the reference in the final test.
